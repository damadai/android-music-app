1. If I want to create a bottom dialog that contains controllers, should I use Fragments everywhere?
Like, one BaseActivity that contains the dialog, and that activity will host every other screen of the app.
In this case, every screen should be a Fragment.

- I think yes, because how would you persist the state of the bottom dialog. On the other hand, it will be hard to
control the back stack with Fragments.

Basically, you will have 2 choices here:

 - Pass the state of the dialog from one screen to another.
 - Host all Fragments in one Activity, but struggle with managing the back stack.

Or there might be a third option where you can share the same piece of UI across different Activities.
